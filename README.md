# IE9 and custom headers

This is a test repo to finally answer the dreaded question:

> Can we send custom headers in an AJAX request with IE9 or not?

Conflicting sources over the Interwebs led to the building of this repo.

And the answer is:

# YES!

At least, for the use case I'm interested in, and using jQuery, yes.

Feel free to provide more examples to complete the repo.

# Usage

`npm install && node index.js`

Open your browser to `http://0.0.0.0:3000`.
